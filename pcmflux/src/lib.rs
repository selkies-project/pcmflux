//! pcmflux: PulseAudio/PipeWire audio capture with Opus encoding, plus mic-uplink
//! playback, exposed as a pure-Rust PyO3 extension (the audio sibling of pixelflux).
//!
//! The capture thread pulls S16LE PCM fragments from a PulseAudio record stream,
//! reassembles them into fixed-size Opus frames, encodes them (mono/stereo via the
//! `opus` crate, 5.1/7.1 surround via the multistream API), optionally wraps them in
//! RFC 2198 RED framing — redundant copies of recent frames, so a client on a lossy
//! transport rebuilds a dropped packet from the next one it receives instead of stalling
//! for a retransmit — and hands each frame to a delivery thread that runs the Python
//! callback off the audio path, so a slow or GIL-blocked callback can never stall the
//! PulseAudio pump. The playback path mirrors this in reverse: it decodes the Opus mic
//! uplink and writes PCM into a virtual sink.
//!
//! Concurrency design (the invariants below are load-bearing):
//!   - A lifecycle mutex serializes joining/reassigning the capture thread.
//!   - A single stop_state atomic is the one source of truth (0 = running, -1 =
//!     external stop, a positive value = self-stop recorded under the issuing thread's
//!     tid — the delivery thread's for a callback-issued stop). The
//!     external -1 is stored INSIDE that lock immediately before join, so a stop can
//!     never be lost between observing a live thread and asking it to stop. A
//!     re-entrant self-start undoes only its own self-stop via one compare-exchange,
//!     so a racing external stop is never clobbered.
//!   - The PulseAudio mainloop is pumped with a bounded ~20ms timeout, so a stop is
//!     observed within ~20ms even if the audio source delivers no data (is wedged).
//!   - The GIL is released around join, because joining the capture thread transitively
//!     joins the delivery thread, whose in-flight Python callback needs the GIL; holding
//!     it while joining would deadlock.
//!   - A callback may itself call stop/start; the callback runs on the delivery thread,
//!     so that re-entrant case is detected via the delivery thread's OS tid (the capture
//!     thread's tid is checked too) and short-circuits without joining — a join from
//!     inside the callback would cycle (stopper joins capture, capture joins delivery,
//!     delivery is the stopper).

/// thread would tie capture cadence to the GIL and let any Python stall starve the audio.
/// The body handed to `spawn_worker`.
///
/// Publishes `start_state` for the handshake (`RUNNING` on entering the hot loop, `FAILED`
/// with a `last_error` on any terminal error, `IDLE` on a clean stop) and returns when
/// `stop_state` leaves `STOP_NONE` or on a fatal error. The startup sequence, in order:
///
/// 1. **Seed the mirrors**: copies the settings snapshot (already validated by
///    `extract_settings`) into the `Inner` per-frame atomics.
/// 2. **Buffer attr / latency**: a configured `latency_ms` uses `ADJUST_LATENCY` with
///    `fragsize` set to that latency; otherwise `fragsize` is floored at ~20 ms, which yields
///    a prompt first frame and avoids PipeWire's ~2 s default fragment.
/// 3. **Connect + probe**: drives the context to `Ready` on the bounded pump (re-checking
///    `stop_pending` each turn), and up-front validates a NAMED device via an introspect
///    probe — an async `connect_record` would not fail synchronously on a bad name. The probe
///    closure is called from C inside mainloop dispatch, so its body is `catch_unwind`-guarded
///    to keep a panic from unwinding across the FFI boundary.
/// 4. **Encoder + record stream**: creates the `PcmEncoder` (mono/stereo or surround) and
///    drives the record stream to `Ready`.
/// 5. **Delivery thread**: spawns the delivery thread that pops from the `DeliveryRing` and
///    runs the Python callback there, so GIL stalls cannot back up the PA pump; a callback
///    error is reported as an unraisable exception and never propagates into the loop. The
///    buffer pool is sized to the worst-case body — RED prefix plus a max Opus packet, scaled
///    by stream count for surround (one self-delimited packet per stream). A run without a
///    callback spawns no delivery thread: its ring starts closed, so every encoded frame goes
///    back to the pool and only the output socket is served.
/// 6. **Hot loop**: `pump`s on the ~20 ms bound, then drains every buffered fragment via
///    peek/discard (a `Hole` is an xrun — the read index is just advanced), feeding each into
///    `RunState`. A stop is observed within the pump bound even when the source is wedged. On
///    exit it disconnects the stream, drops the encoder, closes and joins the delivery ring,
///    and reports any dropped stale frames.
///
/// One PulseAudio session for capture: mainloop, context, and the record stream,
/// all recreated together on reconnect.
/// Drop order matters (declaration order): the stream must die first, then its
/// owning context, then the mainloop both pulse threads pump — the reverse of
/// the build. A wrong order is a use-after-free on the libpulse side.

/// sink removed). Breaking out there would leave the mic uplink dead until something
/// upstream noticed and restarted the whole playback, losing every packet in between, so
/// the session is reopened with the same backoff and budgets capture uses.
///
/// **Buffer sizing and the prebuf timing rule** (load-bearing): `tlength` is the target
/// latency in bytes, and `prebuf` is a quarter of it, floored to one frame. `prebuf` must
/// NOT be zero: with `prebuf == 0` PulseAudio starts playback instantly, the realtime read
/// pointer then runs ahead of the write index, and every `SeekMode::Relative` write lands
/// "in the past" — the server silently discards it forever (observed as bytes flowing at
/// exactly realtime rate while the sink monitor stayed silent). A quarter-buffer prebuf makes
/// the stream wait for data before starting and re-prebuffer after each underrun, so a late
/// chunk plays slightly delayed instead of vanishing.
///
/// **Hot loop**: `pump`s on the ~20 ms bound, then, whenever the server is writable, drains
/// that many bytes from the `PlayQueue` (clamped and frame-aligned) and writes them with
/// `free_cb = None`, so PA copies the bytes and the `scratch` buffer is reused next
/// iteration. Newly queued bytes are picked up on the next pump — no cross-thread wakeup is
/// needed, mirroring capture's poll style — and a stop is observed within the pump bound.
/// Each drain feeds `StandingDepth`, and depth that stood through a whole window is
/// spliced out of the queue's head, so the uplink's delay returns to the sink's own
/// buffer after a burst and does not grow with a client clock running fast.
