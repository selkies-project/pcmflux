# Working on this repository

pcmflux is the audio-capture and encode library behind
[selkies](https://github.com/selkies-project/selkies), and is developed together with it and with
[pixelflux](https://github.com/selkies-project/pixelflux) (screen capture and video encode). A change in one often
belongs in another; coordinate across all three.

Use web search, web fetch, and other available tools as necessary. Make sure that the comments or documentation are
not too verbose (do not add comments more fit for a PR summary than a comment). Do not leave arbitrary numbers (such
as issue or task numbers) in the code or documentation. Do not use inline comments. Do not use comments or
documentation that describe arbitrary code changes of previous states compared to the current code that do not need
explanation. The code commenting should reflect the current state of the codebase and be used to convey information
to an LLM bot or developer. Write American English -- color, behavior, center, initialize, canceled -- except
where a name belongs to something upstream, such as a Wayland `Cancelled` event or an NVENC `colourMatrix` field.

Empirical testing is possible for everything here, including implementation, auditing, validation, and verification,
and every change is validated before it is reported. `cargo test --lib` is the floor, and
`cargo test --release bench_emit_assembly -- --ignored --nocapture` prints the assembly measurement to quote rather
than assert. The test binary links the interpreter because pyo3's `extension-module` is a crate feature the Python
build alone asks for (`features` on the `RustExtension` in `setup.py`); putting it back on the pyo3 dependency itself
would leave `cargo test` unable to link. The crate's `Cargo.toml` is the one place the version lives: `setup.py` reads it, spelling a semver
pre-release the PEP 440 way (`2.1.0-rc.1` is `2.1.0rc1` to pip), and the release workflow stamps the tag into the
manifest and the lock, so a build ahead of a release carries the series version and a release the tag's. End to end, a change is a wheel (`pip wheel . --no-deps`) installed into a
selkies sandbox as the Agentic Development section of that repository's `docs/development.md` describes, driven by its audio suites over
both transports with the installed Firefox and Chrome and Playwright/Selenium/Puppeteer/Cypress WebKit in place of
Safari. Ask before building an environment on a machine that was not set up for one (Miniforge serves a host with a
closed package manager) and take the operator's directives on how it is constructed and constrained. Say which checks
could not run where the hardware for them was not available.

Priority: Latency > Resource Usage >= Quality (non-perceptible or statistically insignificant fluctuations of <= 5% in
latency for quality or bandwidth consistency is acceptable, and using a slight more GPU resources or CPU cores is also
acceptable if without latency impact and substantial quality improvement) >> Overall Bandwidth Efficiency (since
encoded frames are only used once unlike .mp4/.mkv)

Note that parity between X11 and Wayland, as well as between WebSockets and WebRTC, or between the default dashboard
and the wish dashboard, is considered a key focus (things that were not wired up correctly on either side, and similar
discrepancies, are subject to fixes or deduplication). I prefer deduplicating code that performs similar purposes
across different modes over keeping duplicate code for no reason and more fragility. Refactor through deduplication if
you are confident there will be no regressions (or able to validate regressions). Screen coroutine usage in both
Python and JavaScript, as well as thread usage in all languages, so that everything is performant and does not lead to
hanging or lagging. Performance preservation or improvements such as zero-copy and latency-reducing measures are
always important, and the GIL is held no longer than the work needs. End-to-end latency and an unrestricted frame
rate are separate goals rather than two ends of one dial: neither is spent to buy the other. A change never drops a
capability or falls back to an older implementation to make itself simpler; where one seems to be in the way, say
what it is rather than removing it. Note that compatibility should be ensured for Python 3.9 to 3.15 or even higher.
A defect that predates the change you are making is still in scope: finding it does not make it someone else's,
and "pre-existing" is not a reason to leave it. Fix it, or say precisely what is broken, what you ruled out, and
what you would do next. The same applies to a failure you cannot reproduce yet -- narrow it until it is either
fixed or precisely described, and never let a test that fails for an unknown reason pass unremarked.

A change is ready when four questions have answers, and the commit or pull request gives them to the reviewer:
was the defect, or the missing behavior, reproduced on the code before the change (a failing check or a measurement
on the old tree, not an argument from the source); is it gone, or present, on the exact code being committed, through
the path a user takes rather than a switch a user would never flip (a developer toggle, a debug key, a knob of the
rig); can the change affect behavior it was not aimed at, and what was run to know; and is the change stripped to what
makes it work, since every line the first two answers do not need is noise the maintainers have to sift. A change in an
area a maintainer has said they are working on goes to a branch and a pull request carrying those answers, never
straight to `main`, whatever standing permission to push `main` exists. An issue is closed by a maintainer,
never by you. A pull request's `Closes` keyword is not you closing it; the maintainer's merge is.
An optional path another component may offer
(a protocol a compositor advertises, a driver feature, a device) is taken only when its presence is detected and never
as the default: that it is exposed is not proof it works, and a reviewer has to be able to tell what runs where.

`LICENSES.md` inventories the crates, the linked libpulse (LGPL-2.1-or-later), and the statically linked libopus (BSD-3-Clause);
`pcmflux/deny.toml` keeps the crate graph permissive (the `Licenses` workflow runs it). A new crate that links
native code gets a row there.

Update this file when certain details change.
